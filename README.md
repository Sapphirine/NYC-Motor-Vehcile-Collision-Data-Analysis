# NYC-Motor-Vehcile-Collision-Data-Analysis
The project gives more detail about the process used for analysis of motor vehicle collision data. The data for the motor vehicle collisions was provided by an open 
data-set provided by NYC Open Data. Spark SQL was used for the data analysis and interesting results were visualized using C3.js. A machine learning algorithm was also used to find out interesting patterns between different kinds of accidents.
